Server part of instant messaging app written in Ktor with Kotlin

First step of creating an instant messaging app with Flutter. 

My plan is also to learn creating my own backend server instead of using technologies like Firebase Real-Time Database.

MongoDB used as Database. 

WebSocket used for real time connection between clients.
